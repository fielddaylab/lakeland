1. "kingdoms & castles" / "econauts"
You are a farm. Tile based building.

- resources
- - $
- - crop ($)
- - - apply to livestock
- - poop ($/5)
- - - apply to crop to (sloppily) increases chem levels
- - fertilizer ($$)
- - - apply to crop to precisely increases chem levels
- - valuables (biogas, oils, etc...) ($)
- - - useless
- tiles (have phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium)
- - land (-)
- - - default
- - water (-)
- - - chem minimums produce blooms
- - storage ($)
- - - required to hold crop/poop/fertilizer
- - dump ($)
- - - can aggregate a lot of material
- - - can add to, can't remove from
- - - rain produces runoff
- - crop ($)
- - - require minimum chem levels
- - - deplete chems
- - - generate crop
- - - generate $
- - - rain produces runoff
- - livestock ($)
- - - consume crop
- - - generate poop
- - - generate $
- - digester ($$$)
- - - consume poop
- - - generate fertilizer
- - - generate valuables
- - local transport ($)
- - - collect/distribute collected/consumed content
- - global (resource-specific) transport ($$$)
- - - sells excess
- progression
- - you have 1 crop, 1 livestock, 1 local transport, 1 global crop transport
- - "build a storage"
- - time passes, accrue food, poop, maybe build another structure
- - "food delivery service ready- prepare what you want to sell"
- - "fertilizer sellers taking orders"
- - time passes, build things with the money you have
- - "rains"
- - continue to build
- - "lake getting gross"
- tensions
- - do we offer "gov legistlation" as fail state?
- - do we offer "gov subsidies" as mechanic?
- - how to include "consorsium" as solution to afford complex/expensive infrastructure?
- - following econauts' footsteps infeasable, but easy to see desire for asymmetrical multiplayer ("i play as city", "i play as shit transport startup", etc...)

2. "Sustainable U"
???
- asymmetric phosphorus cycle (fast in bio, slow in geo)

3.a "Exploding Unicorns"
There is a "complex" underlying system. Cards correspond to small widgets within system.

- cards
- - phosphorus
- - nitrogen
- - potassium
- - livestock ($$)
- - farmland ($)
- - poop
- - water
- tokens
- - $
- zones
- - lake
- - (my) digester
- - bank
- hold 5 cards at a time
- play 1xP+N+K+water+farmland = 2x$
- play 1x livestock+water = 3x$+poop
- play 1x poop = 1xP+N+K+roll dice for additional P+N+K
- query lake for water- function of pollution+random whether success
- excess cards either get payed to exhaust, otherwise into the lake
- pay 5x$ for digester
- poop+through digester=P+N+K+$
- every transport costs 1x$ (anyone can pay); other than that, as much as you want
- first to nx$ wins

3.b "Pandemic"
You are a farm. Work to grow profits in cooperation/at tension with other farms and the city and the government and ...

4. Simmiland
- dumb automatons
- you're "city planner"
- can allocate land as farm
- produces "some" food
- can allocate land as livestock
- produces "some" food, + poop
- poop is used on farms to up production
- pollutes land w/ phosphorus
- (automotons dumb- don't care)
- lakes source of _great_ pleasure for automatons
- bathing = happiness
- work = less happy
- need to be fed
- research = less happy
- roads = faster movement?
- trains/pipelines/etc...
- digester = poop more easily transportable + "fuel" (methane)
