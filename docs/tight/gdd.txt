3 major "moves":
- buy farm
- buy home
- buy livestock (ranch?)

mechanics:
- farms grow food according to phosphorus levels
- food growth takes up phosphorus
- livestock are fed food and produce poop
- poop can deposit phosphorus
- rain (and other environmental factors) sink phosphorus into watersheds
- sims cannot exist without a home
- sims need food to survive
- sims will not work if they can't play in water (require pollution free zone)

possible sim actions:
- eat
- sleep
- farm
- feed livestock
- fertilize farm
- play in water
- sell things
- store/retrieve things (in/from storage)

progression:
- 16x16 tile grid
- "place first home" free
- $100 in bank
- buy farm
- sell excess food to buy new house
- at each new house buy, grid increases by 2
- farm runs out of nutrients
- buy livestock
- repeat grow community -> grow production cycle until unsustainable
- growth tension / source of equilibrium:
- - "selling" requires bringing excess to edge, which is moving further from center of population, which means excess just aggregates in middle
- - can no longer rely on supply output from middle (though supply needs retain)

experience:
- you'll notice the irreversable soiling of used land/water
- "growth" as only escape from soiling
- growth simultaneously is increased burden
- phosphorus unmaintainable
- only in-game solution for maximization: build indefinitely increasing permanent poop storage (obviously unsustainable)
- takeaway: what can be done to counter this aggregation of phosphorus? (NOT IN-GAME)
- - new tech
- - distribution networks
- - regulations preventing centralization
