- "place food" should be trigger to seek out hungry people to eat it
- introduce timer when first waiting for farm to grow
- if you mark second corn (during sell tutorial) to "sell", popup saying "woah, you'll need _some_ corn to feed your people"

- pace tuts w/ achievements (wait a bit before popping up advisor)
- timers on "out to market" signs

- display "currently exporting dudes"
- if quickbuy house- skip appropriate tut

- randomize fulfillment priorities (equal chance to farm-related and export)
