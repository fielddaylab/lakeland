- not "ope, your town isn't doing so well"- needs to be "someone died!- your town isn't..."
- should have an earlier repeated "your farm is low nutrition!"
- if you sell your last corn, it should say "that's your last corn at the moment- if you sell it, people won't have anything to eat!"
- make it rain even less often

- shop description
- shop formatting
- two advisors look very similar
- need white fertilizer assets
- do the stats on the bottom matter?
- notification on first milk
- dairy should have an indicator: "needs feed"
- farm should have an indicator: "needs water"
- farm/dairy should have an indicator: "needs harvesting/milking"
- re-pop-up "your farm is low nutrition"



- handle many lines of fertilizer on dot bar
- incl faded "needs" in tile inspector; filled when needs met (farms: water, dairy: feed)
- fade "production" according to ability to produce (farms: corn when harvestable; dairy: milk/poop when milkable)
- amortize flow across ticks
- allow building on top of (to destroy) roads
- allow building a road (to destroy) signs?
- money particles
- correctly align arrows
- remove washout where unnecessary
- ppl don't eat milk if it's already on board and marked food

- "buy from shop" clickthroughs to placement if valid; no good

- "place food" should be trigger to seek out hungry people to eat it
- introduce timer when first waiting for farm to grow
- if you mark second corn (during sell tutorial) to "sell", popup saying "woah, you'll need _some_ corn to feed your people"

- pace tuts w/ achievements (wait a bit before popping up advisor)

- display "currently exporting dudes"
- if quickbuy house- skip appropriate tut

- randomize fulfillment priorities (equal chance to farm-related and export)
